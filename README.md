# Weather-Dash

As a developer, I want to understand the process of working with Third-party APIs and their data so that I can be a successful team member for a potential employee.

Weather Dash is a dashboard designed to retrieve the weather forecast from a users chosen city. It is meant to track user input in local storage and displayed for the users reference.

As well as the daily forcast, I wanted to provide a five day forecast.
